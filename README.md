# Nvidia-Cuda-Short-Notes
Short note stack of mine about Nvidia Cuda API, extracted from various books and internet sources.

##What is Nvidia CUDA?

Nvidia CUDA is a parallel programming platform which comes with it's own API developed by Nvidia. CUDA stands for Compute Unified Device Architecture. This API focus on GPGPU (General Purpose Graphics Processing Unit) programming. That in similar term, using gaming GPUs or general computation oriented GPUs such as Nvidia tesla GPUs to use for everyday programming tasks.
To program with this API either CUDA C (ANSI C combined with API interface) or Fortran can be used. 

##What is this Repository About?

This repository is my personal short note stack on Nvidia Cuda that I started because having short notes on github for online reference is rather cool than having actual notebooks. I will list what are the sources of my notes in below and buying links for them if you are interested in full text since this is just a short note that I'm creating for myself and this is no way a study material in anyway.
